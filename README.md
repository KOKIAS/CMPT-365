CMPT 365 Project Report 
 
Objective :  

By characterizing the STI (Spatial Temporal Image) , we can determine which type of wipe the video has used Introduction:  
Video transitions are commonly use for switching scenes in a video. Some of the most popular type of transitions are wipe, cut and dissolve. STI (spatial temporal image) is “an image which contains video content for each frame along the ordinate axis, versus time along the abscissa”(quote from project overview).This project aims to make a taxonomy by comparing the 
STI of the different types of wipe. For this project we used two different method to create the STI. 1) Copying Pixels 2) Histogram Difference Programing Language and Platform: Since the programming language and platform requirement are open for this project. We choose to use the same language and platform as of our previous assignment. For language , we choose to use Java as it is one of the language that comes with lots of useful packages. For video processing , we uses OpenCV, as it comes with a built-in class Mat. Mat is a matrix based object, it becomes extremely handy to deal with frames and pixels using it. For User Interface we uses Scene Builder to modify and create the GUI.
