CMPT 365 Project Report 
 
Objective :  

By characterizing the STI (Spatial Temporal Image) determine which type of wipe recommend video:  
Some of the most popular type of transitions are wipe, cut and dissolve. Switching scenes use video transitions in a video. STI is “an image and it contains video content for each frame along the ordinate axis, versus time along the abscissa”(quote from project overview).The project aims taxonomy using comparing the STI of the different types of wipe. For the project we used two different methods to create the STI. 1) Copying Pixels 2) Histogram Difference Programing Language and Platform: Since the programming language and platform requirement are open for project. We choose the same language and platform as of our previous assignment. For language , we choose to use Java as it comes with lots of useful packages. For video processing , we used OpenCV, as it comes with a built-in class Mat. Mat is a matrix based object, it becomes extremely handy to deal with frames and pixels using it. For User Interface we uses Scene Builder to modify and create the GUI.
