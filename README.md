Objective :  STI (Spatial Temporal Image)

The project aims to comparing the STI of the different types of wipe.

  1) Copying Pixels 
  2) Histogram Difference Programing Language and Platform
  
For language: we choose Java. 
 
For video processing: we used OpenCV. The mat is a matrix based object, it becomes handy to deal with frames and pixels using it.
